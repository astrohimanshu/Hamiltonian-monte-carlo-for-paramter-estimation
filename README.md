# Hamiltonian-monte-carlo-for-parameter-estimation 

Implementation of hamiltonian monte carlo in python to estimate cosmological parameters based on the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0608679.pdf. 

**Problem is given here https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/research-centres-and-groups/astrophysics/public/icic/data-analysis-workshop/2016/SN-MCMC-project-2016_1.pdf** 

A visual representation of energies are given for better explaination of how the algorithm works.

Data files needed are uploaded as well
